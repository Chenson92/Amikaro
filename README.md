## Description

Amikaro is a web application that provides a platform for Esperanto speakers and those interested in or curious about Esperanto to connect, meet up, and practice the language together. The app allows users to create accounts, host their own Esperanto events (either locally or online meetups), and delete their events if needed. Visitors can also contribute by making donations to support the development and maintenance of the app.

Esperanto is an international auxiliary language designed to be easy to learn, promoting communication and understanding among people from different linguistic backgrounds. Amikaro seeks to foster a welcoming and inclusive environment for all Esperanto enthusiasts, enabling them to find like-minded individuals to practice and socialize with.
